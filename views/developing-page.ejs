              <strong>I LEVERAGE</strong> AI-native development tools (Amp, Gemini, Codex) to build full-stack web
              applications, translating product ideas into working systems through iterative, language-driven workflows.
              My process combines natural language code generation with coordination across frontend, backend, and
              external services. I have experience integrating APIs, managing environments via CLI, and connecting
              distributed architectures, with a focus on rapid prototyping and strong aesthetic and functional cohesion.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>THE EXPERIENCE</strong> of being an operations professional has informed what I’ve built and how I’ve built
              it. I don’t like paying for expensive software subscriptions. I don’t like irrelevant features. I like smooth,
              minimal, reliable software that doesn’t force me to create an account and won’t deluge me with marketing
              emails.
