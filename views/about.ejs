              <strong>THIS IS</strong> a home for my work. I expect it to change in time. The main page is an RSS feed
              aggregator from Reuters, Al Jazeera, the BBC, and others. Some of the books that have been
              important to me are housed on the reading page; some aren’t. I’m not in a hurry with my writing.
              A little is here, some more is elsewhere, most is yet to arrive. I’m curious about attention,
              prayer, the inner lives of mothers, object relations, and social ethics.

              <strong>I’VE SPENT</strong> the last decade in operations and administration across law, private equity, and tech.
              I’ve managed IT and cybersecurity for a billion-dollar fund. I’ve produced events and managed office
              builds with budgets in excess of $250k. I’ve designed physical workspaces and custom software solutions.
              I moonlight as a florist, and there’s typically a drill on my desk. I’m highly experienced in project
              management, workspace design and implementation, team culture, and event production.
