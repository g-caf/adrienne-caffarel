            This is a home for my work. I expect it to change in time. The main page is an RSS feed
            aggregator from Reuters, Al Jazeera, the BBC, and others. Some of the books that have been
            important to me are housed on the reading page; some aren’t. I’m not in a hurry with my writing.
            A little is here, some more is elsewhere, most is yet to arrive. I’m curious about attention,
            prayer, the inner lives of mothers, object relations, and social ethics.

            I’ve spent the last decade in operations and administration across law, private equity, and tech.
            I’ve managed IT and cybersecurity for a billion-dollar fund. I’ve produced events and managed
            office builds with budgets in excess of $250k. I’ve designed physical workspaces and custom
            software solutions. I moonlight as a florist, and there’s typically a drill on my desk. I’m highly
            experienced in project management, workspace design and implementation, team culture, and event
            production.

            This is what I’m up to when I’m not working: walking, running, reading, writing, crocheting,
            cooking, going to the movies, and spending time with my two cats.
